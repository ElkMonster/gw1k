gw1k Readme
===========

gw1k is an OpenGL based widget toolkit written in C++ and Lua.

It was born as a university project, that's why it's unfinished, unpolished,
lacks documentation, and is generally not recommended for anyone to use unless
you have a lot of time and the will to work your way through the code.

gw1k was created because I needed a flexible widget toolkit based on OpenGL, but
none of the existing projects seemed to fit my needs -- and also at the time, I
didn't even know what I would really need. Therefore, I decided it write my own
toolkit so I would be able to design and customise everything as needed.

Some of the anti-features that make gw1k the widget toolkit you don't want to
use (although these things are expected to change/be fixed in the future):
    - Building the library requires the Code::Blocks IDE
    - There's no tutorial on how to use all the widgets...
    - ...only slight traces of comments in the code
    - There're unfinished or abandoned features and code paths
    - There's leftover code, experimental code, superfluous code

gw1k was used in my master's thesis, developed under pressure of time and not
intended to be used by anyone but me. So please forgive the bad shape of the
code and the project in general.
